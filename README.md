# Turtle-Crossing-Game
This Python Turtle graphics code creates a Frogger-style game. It features a player navigating through moving cars. The main loop manages animation, player input, and collision detection. If the player collides with a car, "Game Over" is displayed. Reaching the screen's top increases the level.
